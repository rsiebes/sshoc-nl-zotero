    # Abstract
    dc:abstract """Objectives: We assessed socioeconomic inequalities in relation to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence among major ethnic groups in The Netherlands.

Methods: We used data from the Hospital Discharge Register and the Population Register to identify all first AMI hospitalisations in The Netherlands between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2007. We included all residents aged 35-74 years at the time of admission. Standardised household disposable income was used as a proxy for socioeconomic position. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs for AMI incidence by income group.

Results: Among ethnic Dutch, the AMI incidence was higher in the low-income group than in the high-income group: adjusted HRs were 2.05 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.10) for men and 2.33 (95% CI 2.23 to 2.43) for women. Importantly, similar socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence were also observed in all minority groups, with the low socioeconomic group having a higher AMI incidence than the high socioeconomic group: adjusted HR ranging from 2.07 (95% CI 1.26 to 3.40) in Moroccans to 2.73 (95% CI 1.55 to 4.80) in Antilleans in men; and from 2.17 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.71) in Indonesians to 3.88 (95% CI 2.36 to 6.38) in Turks in women.

Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate socioeconomic inequalities in AMI incidence in migrant groups and suggest a convergence towards the Dutch general population. If the AMI incidence rates of the low socioeconomic group could be reduced to the level of the high socioeconomic group, this would represent a major public health improvement for all ethnic groups.""" ;
