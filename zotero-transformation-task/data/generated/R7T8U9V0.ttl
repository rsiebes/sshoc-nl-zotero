The research analyzes how market failures in the annuity sector affect retirement planning and life-cycle consumption decisions. Using theoretical models and empirical analysis, the study investigates the value of longevity insurance and its impact on individual welfare across different demographic groups. The work contributes to understanding optimal pension design and the role of government intervention in retirement income markets. Key findings include quantification of welfare losses from annuity market imperfections and policy recommendations for improving retirement security.""" ;
